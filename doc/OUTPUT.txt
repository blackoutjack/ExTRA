Output of the unpack.py script is generated by default in ./unpacked, or
in the directory pointed to by the $UNPACKDIR environment variable. A
subdirectory named for the URL's domain is created (or reused), and a
further subdirectories will be uniquely created to correspond to the
page being retrieved. The files described below will be placed in this
location.

Output files:
[DOMAIN-PATH].original.html: the original HTML file, as downloaded
[DOMAIN-PATH].html: the HTML file stripped of scripts and annotated with
  element id's that help with repacking
[DOMAIN-PATH].js: a concatenation of all the JavaScript content
scripts/: a directory containing all script content in individual files,
  with an attempt to maintain the original relative directory structure


Output of the repack.py script is printed to stdout, and consists of the
JavaScript content reintegrated into the HTML file.
